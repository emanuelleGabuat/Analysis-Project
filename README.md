## Consumer Complaint Analysis

This project analyzes consumer complaints from 2016 to 2020 in the United States to uncover trends, patterns, and opportunities for enhancing products, services, and overall customer experience in financial institutions.

We have developed an interactive dashboard to visualize and analyze consumer complaints, focusing on key performance indicators such as the number of complaints, timely response rates, and resolutions by monetary relief.

Explore how this analysis can serve as a useful tool for financial institutions to better understand and address consumer complaints effectively.
